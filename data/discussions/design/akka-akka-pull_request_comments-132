<viktorklang> I'd be surprised if this is the way to create RoutedActorRefs. Jonas?
<jboner> No this is cheating by using low-level API that shouldn't even be exposed. 
It should be configured to be a routed ref. 
But that will change when Roland is done. 
<jboner> Same here. Should not be used. 
<henrikengstrom> Ok, I'll wait for Rolands fix then.
