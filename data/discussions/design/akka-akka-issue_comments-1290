<bantonsson> It breaks `SerializationCompatibilitySpec`.

Otherwise LGTM.

<patriknw> I think the doc tests should be updated to not use `isTerminated`.
Any internal usages that should be updated?
Any tests that should be updated?
<patriknw> A note in the migration guide would be nice.
<viktorklang> I think the deprecation and the refactoring should be kept separate as one is changing user API and one is internal implementaiton details.
<viktorklang> Also, SerializationCompatibilitySpec seems broken and needs fixing.
<patriknw> I still think the doc tests should be updated to not use isTerminated, since that is user API.
Create another ticket if you don't want to change the internals.
<viktorklang> True, I'll clean up the doc tests
