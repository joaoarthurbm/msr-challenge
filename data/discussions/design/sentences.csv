Well the remote routers need to handle the nodes setting which the local ones do not Hence there must be a translation between local and remote unless the RemoteDeployer would not use local parsing at all, which is obviously even worse If that translation is part of the router interface so that the RemoteDeployer could do it generically then local routers need to know about their remote counterparts which is not possible due to cyclic dependencies between the packages;rkuhn;akka-akka-commit_comments-dac0beb01b9ffe01ef85b3334c7077909321370a;design

How about moving these into akka util;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-426;design
concrete processors should override preRestartProcessor and postRestartProcessor if needed;krasserm;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1700;design
Is there a reason for exposing CompactByteString and ContByteString as return types of the public api should not be a concern to the user just like users should not need to deal with Map1 A user should never be using the CompactByteString object as the ByteString object should be creating compact ByteStrings but the abstract ByteString class should just be returning ByteString;derekjw;akka-akka-issue_comments-462;design
I wanted to ByteStringCompact next to ByteString1 and ByteStrings to keep the three implementations together and so that ByteStringCompact has access to things which are private though currently the critical stuff is all private;oschulz;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-402;design
Should this create the Props only Passing ActorRefFactory if actor context and potentially using it in the wrong place outside the actor;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1700;design
I understand the issue of using an actor context in the wrong place but can you prevent that at all an actor could reply the context to a sender the context is then used in the onSuccess callback;krasserm;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1700;design
currentMessage won't be called if users follow the msg approach discussed It will be called only if users create new outbound messages via This could be another good reason to recommend the msg approach inside processors;krasserm;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1700;design
There should also be a section about the actual ask change move from ActorRef to pattern;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-241;design
think some more things are needed in the migration kit Add the needed implicit conversions in OldActor so that existing code works inside actors;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-241;design
Add needed implicit conversion in this package scala file so that existing code works outside actors;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-241;design
Document as internal and make final;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-241;design
We can not really get away from exposing Node if we move it into a field instead but the problem is that there is no getAndSet on Unsafe so it can not use LOCK So I will move in isEmpty into AbstractNodeQueue and add count;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1283;design
I would definitely recommend making DeadLetterActorRef a subtype extend of EmptyLocalActorRef and remove DeadLetterActorRefLike;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-241;design
why is this class public and not documented guessing this should be private and documented as internal users will be able to use private;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-241;design
any risk with that we can not change this one would it be possible to move to context;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
protected or prevent subclassing by user code;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
I think this class can be private;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
ActorRefProvider does not expose a reference to its ActorSystem which is a good idea because of initialization order;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
A factory to create MessageQueues for an optionally provided ActorContext;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
protected is weaker than protected so what are you saying Subclassing applies to ActorSystem or ActorCell;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
I do not see any value in hiding it The rest of the ActorPath handling is also not private;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
So you do not want people to implement MessageDispatcher;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
it probably makes more sense to mark as private packages these classes provide the most convenient way for passing along the correct;gertv;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-460;design
eaio will be removed I have added a ticket to move the things from org.jboss.netty.akka.util package to akka.util package;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-460;design
config package will become an explicit dependency as well instead of an embedded one clean up;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-460;design
We will make them package protected;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-460;design
Are the things from netty package only used internally or should they be exposed in the API If just internal you could consider to put them into akka util package;hseeberger;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-460;design
I suggest to just wrap in a RemoteTransportException and rethrow and let the layer above decide if it should be logged or not;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-476;design
Just wrap in a RemoteTransportException and let the caller decide if it should be logged or not;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-476;design
This should be private and be documented as internal api;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-476;design
Should not getChild be only in UntypedActorContext;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-639;design
ActorCell class must implement both and ActorContext does not expose the Java variant;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-639;design
This should be pulled out of the trait since it is a constant put move in some object;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-681;design

Should not this be in a companion object;drewhk;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-993;design
If the extension you have a reference to ExtendedActorSystem;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-681;design
LoggingAdapter does not belong in akka package class If you want to log directly then you should use that api directly;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-913;design
it allows the Akka Logging API to be used outside of Actor systems;fommil;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-913;design
An advantage is that it does not require any dependencies;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-913;design
Instead of directly calling into the ConcurrentSocketActor through methods like connect bind you should send messages to the actor;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-92;design
you are calling out to the methods of the Actor which is a violation of the ActorModel model why not put the connect methods inside the funciton they used internally in the actor;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-92;design
they are only invoked from select and should not be invoked from any other site either inside or outside the actor;kro;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-92;design
so move them into the select function so that they are only reachable from within it;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-92;design
I think it is better to create the actor inside the newSocket method and pass the supervisor into it;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-92;design
this method is only ever used in receiveFrames you might as well move the method definition into receiveFrames;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-92;design
will this be exposed in some way in Spray to serve static content;drewhk;akka-akka-issue_comments-1321;design
do we need to expose this in ActorRefProvider interface;patriknw;akka-akka-commit_comments-9c762dec2062f7a651363a6cc90d8105126d8f35;design
Since this is all so similar and now in quite a thought through state I am going to take a crack at refactoring it to one generic solution;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-344;design

Weird if the test passes;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-681;general
this test name suggests more than the test actually verifies;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1030;general
this is a neat test harness;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1030;general
We should enumerate which tests we need;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1030;general
This may be the cause of the instabilities we have seen with the tests We have already got rid of most of the isTerminated but this instance was forgotten;jrudolph;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1030;general
without it this test fails;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1232;general
Let us verify that again but I think it had something with test protocol not registered which is a good error to log;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1232;general
then I misunderstood the error message I will revisit that and probably have to delete that test or do you have a suggestion of how to test;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1232;general
has it been tested on linux;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-476;general
first run on jenkins was successful which does not mean that it is fixed but anyway a good start;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-940;general

That is the beauty with actor logging you do not need to get the loop on the same stack;rkuhn;akka-akka-issue_comments-332;general
What about returning 0 here to handle potentially enqueued commands It is not immediately clear to me that this can not be an infinite loop in the worst case;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1355;general
alright do you prefer to do the removal inside the above loop;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1459;general
ok we will keep the test I have changed the loop count Will merge;patriknw;akka-akka-issue_comments-1502;general

The variant Viktor proposed will actually run the refresh() while I was referring to making the sending of RefreshCache messages recurring While those messages could potentially pile up running the refresh job should be fine if it is done synchronously I still think that the scheduleOnce approach is the easiest to grasp and also it does not leave state lingering around which needs to be cleaned up;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-485;general
Not likely but lets open a ticket about fixing all such occurences separately;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-997;general

still smells like a bug is hiding in there somewhere;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-746;general
This fix is still relevant because you expect to be able to call getBodyAs several times with the same result adding a debug log stmt should not break things;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-894;general

we normally use unique names of the barriers to simplify debugging and this tests had already one;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-818;general

Because newMemberSet is a Set but I need it to be a SortedSet See the comment about bug in Scala There is no CanBuildFrom for SortedSet;jboner;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-329;general
mistake by me changed from debug when debugging fixing now;jboner;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-281;general
very strange indeed It would be possible to work around that compiler bug it is adding the generated closure to the public static members but it is broken presumably because it is indeed nested within the by using lazy val but that is too expensive for this minor wart;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-250;general

Yep good idea I used that block for debugging at one point which is why it is so verbose;derekjw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-199;general
Also you have a bug you a preprending that to that instead of this which means that you are lacking a test;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1709;general

can not we change this Array to this bug is just another sign that the small performance advantage of array when parsing the original string is not worth it;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1389;general
It helps debugging and no security is violated as there is none;drewhk;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1338;general

Ideally line breaks should be done virtually by formatting in your editor Since that is not the case I do not think we should sacrifice readability for people using unix terminals 120 is a good modern limit;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-719;general

I could not find anything about reformatting MDC values so this will just print a mildly meaningless 10 digit number What we can do is to print the time of day in UTC side stepping the expensive calendar formatting issues This will usually be well correlated with the SLF4J timestamp because the delay between the generation of the Event and the call to log should not be that long;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1356;general
True but I do not want to waste CPU formatting something that might not be used and then the user can not really reformat easily;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1356;general
is this formatting looking good;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1095;general
this is an automatic formatting by scalariform in eclipse only when there is;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1033;general
I thought I had done that but some reformatting or automatic importing must have messed it up again Will fix;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1027;general

Could you revert this formatting change;jboner;akka-akka-commit_comments-8f7bd6909a7357b05d2ffeeebf51c8073ec1d742;general
Nice formatting change Should switch to the FSMDocTest approach because that still leaks when tests fail;rkuhn;akka-akka-commit_comments-8c5d10df8e75aec760e39dd71658b963febd2428;general
this file should have worked without reformatting as far as I can see reformatting it is fine but want to be sure you did not reformat because the parser was upset about the original;havocp;akka-akka-commit_comments-4b8f11ea92ab3fb4809e2ca84b11ac93771477bb;general
ouch I blame my scrapped Eclipse workspace for losing this piece of configuration;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-705;general
we have those to be able to run tests directly inside Eclipse when the scalatests runner is working we will remove all of them;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-700;general
yes it looks a lot more funny outside of Eclipse;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-541;general
imports at top of file is normally something I just want the IDE to take care of and Eclipse does not do this kind of multi import but I have changed it for you;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-214d;general
