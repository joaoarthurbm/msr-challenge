<viktorklang> Wat?
<viktorklang> How expensive is this?
<viktorklang> What about wrap-around?
<viktorklang> Do we need "time of failure"? or would it be enough to store a Deadline for when it is to be pruned?
<viktorklang> markAsQuarantined
<viktorklang> A "why" would be nice to comment here
<drewhk> GAAAAA! Nooo.... Thanks!
<viktorklang> Is there a reason why the notification goes out prior to the registration?
<drewhk> We use it during shutdown. This whole structure is specific to this actor,  
and should not be used anywhere else.
<drewhk> We can go with Deadline.
<drewhk> It does not really matter here, but it probably makes sense to move it  
before the creation of the endpoint.
<viktorklang> nice catch
<viktorklang> I don't see what "inbound" as a var buys us, as a def it will be false when handle is set to None in the line above.
<drewhk> It affects lifecycle event logging (which need to know the direction), and  
the inboundness of an EndpointWriter could change by a restart (after  
restart it could be only outbound)
<patriknw> why not ordinary `Map`?
AFAIK a Map is a HashMap when more than 4 elements
<patriknw> so the race was around here, looks good
<patriknw> Deadline +1
<rkuhn> you donâ€™t need `Long` here, it should also work with `Int`
<rkuhn> `3.seconds.dilated`?
<rkuhn> what is supposed to happen if registering two writers for the same address? (i.e. why is that not tested?)
<drewhk> It is not the job of this structure to enforce that. On the other hand it  
makes sense to throw an exception in that case.
<drewhk> Do you think it is needed? This is local communication.
<patriknw> I think it should be dilated (doesn't hurt). 3 seconds is not always enough on slow jenkins
