<patriknw> this should go inside `RemoteWatcher.props`
same thing at other places that use props factory method pattern
<patriknw> you changed this to throw, please explain
<patriknw> line break
<rkuhn> returning an EmptyLocalActorRef from actorOf is not consistent with the other error cases, where we bail out with an exception
<patriknw> `akka.actor.serialize-creators` is defined in several reference.conf files
Is the merge order of reference.conf files defined?
hmm
<rkuhn> it is in classpath order, but you’re right: I’ll add a test which just verifies that this setting was applied (in each of the projects)
<patriknw> ok, I looked at what kind of exceptions could be thrown here, and it is mostly from `localAddressForRemote` and that is in the IllegalArgumentException category, so all fine. Good!
<patriknw> yes that is a good solution
<rkuhn> that is not necessarily a good idea in all cases
<rkuhn> I’ll leave it as is for now, because I don’t see a clear down-side to my approach and the change is somewhat cosmetic, so it can also be done after RC1
<patriknw> well, for these internal actors, that are not intended to be remote deployed it must be better to define all props in the props factory, why not?
of course I didn't mean "all" as in those in contrib
