<viktorklang> what about sun.misc.Unsafe?
<gertv> The import for sun.misc is marked optional for now to allow for resolution of the bundle in most OSGi environment.  In my example, the package didn't get resolved and my mini-example still worked fine, but if it is really required, the only solution is probably to document that this needs to get configured properly in the OSGi framework (either using boot delegation or as a system bundle export) but that would probably also mean that Akka only works on Sun JREs, I guess?
<viktorklang> IT's definitely a required entity. An no, it works for virtually all VMs out there, atleast according to Doug Lea.
<gertv> OK, cool - thanks for the feedback! I'll remove the optional attribute from that import then and perhaps add a doc page under additional/ or something to clarify what needs to be changed for an OSGi environment instead?
<hseeberger> I think we should only export akka*, not the other ones.
<hseeberger> Oh, and I don't believe in such a compatibility story: Better go for [2.1, 2.2)
<viktorklang> Akka will only be binary compatible within minor releases. (so 2.0.x, 2.1.x etc)
<hseeberger> Yes, that's why I propose to fix the version range to [2.1, 2.2) which means 2.1 to 2.1.x.
<viktorklang> Ah, sorry about that, glanced too quick, didn't notice the "exclusive" )
<gertv> Yeah, it probably makes more sense to mark com.eaio.* and org.jboss.netty.akka.util.* as private packages.  However, for com.typesafe.config.*, I would personally keep that export because at the moment, these classes provide the most convenient way for passing along the correct classloaders to make sure that configuration files can get loaded.

Perhaps once we have these initial OSGi headers sorted, we can add an akka-osgi module which does the right thing in an OSGi environment (e.g. providing an easy to easy Activator implementation and/or a Blueprint namespace handler to set up the system.
<gertv> OK, thanks for the feedback once again!
<hseeberger> You are right: _com.typesafe.config.*_ should be exported
<gertv> Okido - I'll make the necessary changes and add them to the pull request then.  Thanks for the feedback!
<viktorklang> Jut as a FYI: com.eaio will be dropped, I've added a ticket to move the things from org.jboss.netty.akka.util to akka.util.
com.typesafe.config will become an explicit dependency as well, instead of an embedded one. This will hopefully clean up the exportPackage
<hseeberger> Are the things from org.jboss.netty.* only used internally or should they be exposed in the API? If just internal, you could consider to put them into akka.internal.util.
<viktorklang> We'll make them package protected
