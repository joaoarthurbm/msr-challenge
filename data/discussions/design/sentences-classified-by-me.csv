To create a Finagle Thrift service you must implement the ServiceIface Interface that a custom Thrift compiler generates for your service Scrooge wraps your service method return values with asynchronous;joao;id;design

btw if you want to retain the debugging information here its often useful you should probably either 1 use logging at a debug level or 2 pass a debug flag into the codec constructor;joao;id;design

Well the remote routers need to handle the nodes setting which the local ones do not Hence there must be a translation between local and remote unless the RemoteDeployer would not use local parsing at all which is obviously even worse If that translation is part of the router interface so that the RemoteDeployer could do it generically then local routers need to know about their remote counterparts which is not possible due to cyclic dependencies between the packages;rkuhn;akka-akka-commit_comments-dac0beb01b9ffe01ef85b3334c7077909321370a;design

well for these internal actors that are not intended to be remote deployed it must be better to define all props in the props factory;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1500;design
I think a proper fix is to be able to pass in a ClassLoader to createActorSystem it should not default to class this overrides Thread.getContextClassloader;viktorklang;akka-akka-issue_comments-875;design
should we make it to make it consumable for java otherwise these should be INTERNAL API;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1700;design

The reason for private is that it is used by the RecoverOnRestart class will become either INTERNAL API or private;krasserm;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1700;design
What about moving the above preStart implementation to Processor and make it final so that concrete processors can only override preRestartProcessor;krasserm;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1700;design
How about moving these into akka util;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-426;design
concrete processors should override preRestartProcessor and postRestartProcessor if needed;krasserm;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1700;design
Is there a reason for exposing CompactByteString and ContByteString as return types of the public api should not be a concern to the user just like users should not need to deal with Map1 A user should never be using the CompactByteString object as the ByteString object should be creating compact ByteStrings but the abstract ByteString class should just be returning ByteString;derekjw;akka-akka-issue_comments-462;design
I wanted to ByteStringCompact next to ByteString1 and ByteStrings to keep the three implementations together and so that ByteStringCompact has access to things which are private though currently the critical stuff is all private;oschulz;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-402;design
Should this create the Props only Passing ActorRefFactory if actor context and potentially using it in the wrong place outside the actor;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1700;design
I understand the issue of using an actor context in the wrong place but can you prevent that at all an actor could reply the context to a sender the context is then used in the onSuccess callback;krasserm;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1700;design
currentMessage won't be called if users follow the msg approach discussed It will be called only if users create new outbound messages via This could be another good reason to recommend the msg approach inside processors;krasserm;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1700;design
There should also be a section about the actual ask change move from ActorRef to pattern;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-241;design
think some more things are needed in the migration kit Add the needed implicit conversions in OldActor so that existing code works inside actors;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-241;design
Add needed implicit conversion in this package scala file so that existing code works outside actors;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-241;design
Document as internal and make final;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-241;design
We can not really get away from exposing Node if we move it into a field instead but the problem is that there is no getAndSet on Unsafe so it can not use LOCK So I will move in isEmpty into AbstractNodeQueue and add count;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1283;design
I would definitely recommend making DeadLetterActorRef a subtype extend of EmptyLocalActorRef and remove DeadLetterActorRefLike;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-241;design
why is this class public and not documented guessing this should be private and documented as internal users will be able to use private;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-241;design
any risk with that we can not change this one would it be possible to move to context;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
protected or prevent subclassing by user code;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
I think this class can be private;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
ActorRefProvider does not expose a reference to its ActorSystem which is a good idea because of initialization order;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
A factory to create MessageQueues for an optionally provided ActorContext;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
protected is weaker than protected so what are you saying Subclassing applies to ActorSystem or ActorCell;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
I do not see any value in hiding it The rest of the ActorPath handling is also not private;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
So you do not want people to implement MessageDispatcher;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-456;design
it probably makes more sense to mark as private packages these classes provide the most convenient way for passing along the correct;gertv;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-460;design
eaio will be removed I have added a ticket to move the things from org.jboss.netty.akka.util package to akka.util package;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-460;design
config package will become an explicit dependency as well instead of an embedded one clean up;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-460;design

Are the things from netty package only used internally or should they be exposed in the API If just internal you could consider to put them into akka util package;hseeberger;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-460;design
I suggest to just wrap in a RemoteTransportException and rethrow and let the layer above decide if it should be logged or not;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-476;design
Just wrap in a RemoteTransportException and let the caller decide if it should be logged or not;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-476;design
This should be private and be documented as internal api;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-476;design
Should not getChild be only in UntypedActorContext;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-639;design
ActorCell class must implement both and ActorContext does not expose the Java variant;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-639;design
This should be pulled out of the trait since it is a constant put move in some object;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-681;design

If the extension you have a reference to ExtendedActorSystem;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-681;design
LoggingAdapter does not belong in akka package class If you want to log directly then you should use that api directly;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-913;design
it allows the Akka Logging API to be used outside of Actor systems;fommil;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-913;design
An advantage is that it does not require any dependencies;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-913;design
Instead of directly calling into the ConcurrentSocketActor through methods like connect bind you should send messages to the actor;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-92;design
you are calling out to the methods of the Actor which is a violation of the ActorModel model why not put the connect methods inside the funciton they used internally in the actor;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-92;design
they are only invoked from select and should not be invoked from any other site either inside or outside the actor;kro;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-92;design
so move them into the select function so that they are only reachable from within it;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-92;design
I think it is better to create the actor inside the newSocket method and pass the supervisor into it;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-92;design
this method is only ever used in receiveFrames you might as well move the method definition into receiveFrames;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-92;design
will this be exposed in some way in Spray to serve static content;drewhk;akka-akka-issue_comments-1321;design
do we need to expose this in ActorRefProvider interface;patriknw;akka-akka-commit_comments-9c762dec2062f7a651363a6cc90d8105126d8f35;design
Since this is all so similar and now in quite a thought through state I am going to take a crack at refactoring it to one generic solution;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-344;design

this test name suggests more than the test actually verifies;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1030;general
this is a neat test harness;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1030;general
We should enumerate which tests we need;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1030;general

without it this test fails;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1232;general
Let us verify that again but I think it had something with test protocol not registered which is a good error to log;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1232;general
then I misunderstood the error message I will revisit that and probably have to delete that test or do you have a suggestion of how to test;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1232;general
has it been tested on linux;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-476;general

That is the beauty with actor logging you do not need to get the loop on the same stack;rkuhn;akka-akka-issue_comments-332;general
What about returning 0 here to handle potentially enqueued commands It is not immediately clear to me that this can not be an infinite loop in the worst case;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1355;general
alright do you prefer to do the removal inside the above loop;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1459;general
ok we will keep the test I have changed the loop count Will merge;patriknw;akka-akka-issue_comments-1502;general

The variant Viktor proposed will actually run the refresh() while I was referring to making the sending of RefreshCache messages recurring While those messages could potentially pile up running the refresh job should be fine if it is done synchronously I still think that the scheduleOnce approach is the easiest to grasp and also it does not leave state lingering around which needs to be cleaned up;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-485;general
Not likely but lets open a ticket about fixing all such occurences separately;viktorklang;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-997;general

still smells like a bug is hiding in there somewhere;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-746;general
This fix is still relevant because you expect to be able to call getBodyAs several times with the same result adding a debug log stmt should not break things;patriknw;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-894;general

very strange indeed It would be possible to work around that compiler bug it is adding the generated closure to the public static members but it is broken presumably because it is indeed nested within the by using lazy val but that is too expensive for this minor wart;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-250;general

I could not find anything about reformatting MDC values so this will just print a mildly meaningless 10 digit number What we can do is to print the time of day in UTC side stepping the expensive calendar formatting issues This will usually be well correlated with the SLF4J timestamp because the delay between the generation of the Event and the call to log should not be that long;rkuhn;akka-akka-pull_request_comments-1356;general

Glad to see youre contributing to the finagle community However I think that it would make more sense to keep feature separate for now Our team is very small and we unfortunately cannot afford to maintain every pull request with big new features that we receive I think that making this a separate library that integrates well with finagle is the best way forward;stevegury;twitter/finagle-issue_comments-202;general

not sure exactly how this has evolved but originally the idea was that with ThreadSpanningOp when you use it you use it only and it wasn t designed to interoperate with the other Lock classes and stuff thus it didn t set threadstate for example it is fine if it is different but does this now imply i can use ThreadSpanningOp interoperably with all the other Lock classes i imagine it won t play nicely with them will read more later,design

take that back turns out health status checks are now available i was able to fix by making a request cluster health MYINDEXNAME wait for status yellow,general
Thanks for fixing that,general
Just a naive question Why do we need to support many different formats for naming options I thought that this kind of test was only here because of deprecated naming Did I miss something here,general
If some of you are interested in the way it is done in Solr I described it in a blog post fulmicoton com posts grouping in solr,general
i can use this hot feature in my client great,general
I think First would be a bad default for this function score it made sense when we did it in the custom filters score I think Multiply would make more sense,general
why it class is final I can not add toString and use this class as base,design
Forgot to reply wrt 0 90 2 Actually even on 0 90 0 I could no longer reproduce the exception from the facet query The query now works without such exception even though data are still mixed with string and float values I will keep investigating and provide more feedbacks if possible Thanks Wei,general
is it possible to create an InputFilter for file upload using InputFactory,design
For what it s worth the multiple index single shard approach is working for us Our application has a new index per week of data anyway so it s not actually too painful for our current usage,general
I thought about this a little more Would it be possible to add a new method to GetField such as isMultiValued to return whether or not the field is mapped as having multiple values This would be similar to LongValues DoubleValues BytesValues etc This would be a suitable compromise for both consistency and general usage,design
From what I understand it was a glitch in amazon failing on one of the APIs can you give it another go,general
That is what I get for not searching before filing an issue,general
Suppressing ETags on a per index or per type basis is another interesting thing yes This depends on the REST action This needs some work in the RestUtils I guess And I have to find out if ETag cacheable setting via cluster update API works,general
Yea it was intentional just trying to make the reproduce script as small as possible Thanks for the fix,general
Adrian we are trying to find a few more ES engineers to work on the metrics team so that hopefully we can begin to tackle some of these feature improvements ourselves and contribute back as more than just users That said I ll ping a few people and see what their thoughts are on this issue,general
Both are certainly better that IOException I d vote for IllegalArgumentException Should I use ElasticSearchIllegalArgumentException or are these somehow reserved for real es stuff,design
Are you still having these problems with current versions of the debian package If so can you provide more information If not please close this issue Thanks,general
this is above my head is 4 a valid timestamp or not It could be relative to 01 01 1970 in millis,general
Here you go gist github com polyfractal 4997040Just realized that the C1 client node was not configured in Ansible so I didn t collect nodes local stats for that node do you want me to redo it and collect stats from that node as well,general
Can you gist the full stack trace of the failure that you get,general
synhershko Rather move the timeout conversation to issue 3129,general
Just committed a fix I hope for the snapshot delete index thingy,general
vhyza thanks for verifying I will pull this in soon,general
And would it be allowed to have two indices with the same alias Index A and B both having alias C,general
I think you should must not add participants as the pattern but simply use the class instead,design
Would love to see this too,general
kimchy Agreed I have to investigate with extra test code and variations of JVM parameters Maybe Mac OS X JVM specific,general
ok rebased into single commit and force pushed Hope this is what you meant,general
The execute method is not abstract and so the Command class is not abstract either because you can use this class,design
I ll push this change since its correct but would like to understand what you are trying to solve specifically just in case I missed something,general
It s backward compatible no breaking I think,general
I checked ElasticSearch 0 19 11 and still see this issue Any thoughts,general
Cam you squash the commits into a single one simpler to apply,general
Closing this issue then Not an elasticsearch issue Still important to keep in mind that running security hardening tools might be an issue in order to get elasticsearch up and running Thanks a lot for your patience and ongoing information delivery,general
The same thing for v0 19 6,general
What s the added value of having such a json response over the current 200 status,general
All right Thank you again for this I m testing it right now,general
vbichkovsky it should work can you provide an example,general
pecke01 any reason why you reopend it,general
Hey How about creating an external client because this class is not really meant to be used directly anyway,design
In more thing I discovered curl XGET localhost 9200 cluster settings Returns the following persistent transient cluster blocks read only false But I would expect persistent transient cluster blocks read only false Is it somehow possible that the type boolean instead of a string is returned,general
looks good we currently fixed using a default boost 1 0 for the matchall queries and will remove when updating to next version,general
I believe this is a bug in Lucene I need to find the bug and once I do will post it here There is another issue in ES issues that talks about it and references the Lucene bug,general
gromgull is it the same stacktrace as above,general
Ubuntu something and initialized a node from code using the Java lib,general
Implemented and will be available in upcoming 0 20 using the ignore indices parameter,general
Added two commits change wildcard parameter name to regex and integration test,general
1Any suggestion how to solve it until its not implemented,general
rmoriz thanks,general
Hey Can t find Regex Query Filter in 0 20 1 Do you have any plans regarding this Best regards,general
1 At the moment this one works for me github com geronime es reindex Implemented in Ruby it has nice progress status with ETA and Ctrl C,general
Cool thanks,general
I wrote a synonym token filter that reloads the synonyms file at given intervals from disk that you can use as a temporary solution until we can use the resource watcher in general github com lindstromhenrik elasticsearch analysis file watcher synonym,general
Lucene 3 6 is ready,general
No the arithmetic failure only shows when asking from node stats for all the instances When I used the local variant none of the nodes raised an exception but the faulty node returned invalid values for the filter caches,general
140 char per line convention I personally don t mind much but that is what we agreed,general
1 encountered it too,general
referenced the wrong issue reopening sorry,general
See issues apache org jira browse LUCENE 5170,general
44 additions and 70 deletions I like it 1,general
What is the best way to retrieve it know The info for aliases is in cluster state but is there a better way,general
You should use this method to instantiate the Configuration in the load method,design
worked on it a bit more and opened 1177 this should solve it you can verify on master or 0 17 branch if you want,general
Closing I think we fixed all the places,general
whats wrong with that its intentional,general
The next version 0 20 will have a better log message in this case so it will be simpler to figure this out,general
Did you mean to spell that monitory jvm enable last gc or should it be monitor jvm enable last gc,general
chrismale didn t think about that for me match does not mean not being scored specifically also the fact that its a query Open for better names,general
Just to complete the picture it works well for day level interval just not minute level and probably hour as well,general
Shouldn t there a more generic class to enable or disable this,general
for scheduling settings we use interval in all other places maybe we can do it here as well so it will be cluster info update interval,general
The following patch closes the issue github com stephane bastian elasticsearch commit 31f5133fadcd195e824bb1cd07807f7cb298f879,general
Please could you provide the docs for the usage of terms so that I can add it to ElasticSearch pmthanksclint,general
Could you post somewhere all log files since cluster restart from all nodes and your configuration You can send me a link via IRC or email if you don t want to post them here,general
kroepke Thanks for the numbers That is still quite a good performance considering it has to scan all the matching documents and aggregate the counts,general
It happens because we change a bit the logic in our settings behavior to have empty strings represent no value set for other reasons We can fix it in the pattern replace one easily,general
davrock no its a 0 90 feature only,general
That might be a duplicate of 2808,general
When is the approximate anticipated release of 0 90 4 we plan on a release early next week,general
Too much magic can be bad Decision made to specify geo points manually,general
I just wrote a Hunspell plugin,general
Great What about second functionality strong and weak filters,general
See 2728,general
Shouldn t we also use this method in the mapmanager constructor,design
Confirming that we see this issue even with 0 90 2 Are there any known work arounds,general
Also would be interseting to see an export of all env vars,general
Ok guys look like I was doing my tests wrong and this issue convinced me there were an issue As my gist show it there is no bug in ES about this Maybe we can close this as the issue is 1 yo,general
I think we shouldn t assume that the payloads are UTF 8 strings Maybe it should rather be base64 encoded,general
You are right amazing it worked at all Closing the issue,general
Thanks It will be helpful for others So I close the issue,general
Sorry for the noise I m wrestling with git squashing and finally did remove the branch A cleaned version is here github,general
I finally had time to fix this issue today day after a holiday is slow around here and you already fixed it,general
The fix is easy but will the current tests simulate the serialization deserialization of the index settings Most tests skip this step,general
Heya thanks for the effort We are deep into the lucene 4 upgrade once its done we are going to go over this pull request,general
This does not really help can you recreate it in a simple test case,general
lucabelluccini can you show me all the commands including the wget to download the archive,general
I think there is no reason that template has to be lowercase I will jsut fix the message to say it relates to name,general
Okay is that by design or is there a reason why that you are using this class,design
I see thank you for the clarification,general
Same issue here any fix or workaround,general
don t think that s the safest approach Can you find a way to a make a factory method tha generates new instances with the value you want but once generated they are constant,design
Thanks Robert Changes pushed and released a new version of the elasticsearch analysis icu plugin,general
What do you mean volatile variable can t be written to which version does it fail on,general
Thanks for the update,general
I answered it on the mailing list closing this issue If there is a problem we can open a specific one,general
single line instead of 2 lines,general
We can use a UserProvider be we will have to add another User class which will support setPassword I think it s useless to add an overhead here UserProvider loadUserByUsername is not possible due to ldap limitation Thats why IMHO it s easier to no use this method,design
Right just pushed a fix,general
After testing this in the 0 20 1 release it works as expected,general
This looks ready Can you squash your commits and add Closes 3202 at the end of the commit message,general
kimchy I think you assume everyone uses some kind of IDE like Eclipse or InteliJ There are still Emacs vi etc users out there If there is a problem with setting up an on line javadoc it would be nice to have at least a maven target to generate it locally,general
Thanks Simon Sorry about the mix up regarding whether or not this was backwards incompatible,general
Our setup does automatic mapping updates so from my perspective all I did was update from 0 90 1 to 0 90 3,general
I started seeing exceptions I ll be more careful before filing issues in the future,general
Closed by github com elasticsearch elasticsearch commit 91de48d2d396ca0868b7d0f6a6e8b2c5265793b9,general
Are you sure this is the good fix We are already in a zen section and we added a ping section Correct me if I m wrong,general
Fix confirmed And thanks for the note about the timeout,general
Would you support having an alias for ObjectId ala asdsdsadsa,general
Hi Guilhem I see that you referenced a SERVER ticket which is great Have you also signed our contributor s agreement There s a link in CONTRIBUTING rst in the root of the repository Also how much does this overlap with other tickets such as jira mongodb org browse SERVER 10190,general
Create new pull request 251,general
For me it works perfectAnd it fixed my initial issue jira mongodb org browse SERVER 5845,general
Created and linked a SERVER ticket so we can start tracking this,general
Hi IanWhalen agreement is signed,general
primary isn t helpful here since todo size 1 implies the collection must be sharded and have a manager,general
Is it enough and normal,general
My suggestion would be to change move method to use move uploaded file and then create a new class just for test environment and override the move method to use rename instead of move uploaded file keeping all other lines in method the same,design
The math is wrong here If delayEnd delayBegin 1 we get rand 1 which will always be zero I think we want 1 delayEnd delayBegin,general
xmcc Can you make the changes that Eric suggested I think these are the only obstacles we are aware of to getting your change included,general
Why I don t like the idea to use abstract here Abstract is ment to define an class that implements some functionality but needs more behaviour added via inheritance to function properly If you want to prevent the possibility to instantiate the class you should protect the constructor but this is not the case I don t want to prevent evolution of this component,design
To clarify a simple jstest like those found in the jstests directory would suffice,general
Also I don t think this works with multiple machines or discover,general
Hi Azat can you please sign the Contributor Agreement,general
this make it much clear,general
Hi Michael Thanks for contributing to MongoDB The fellow who needs to review your pull request Mathias is out of the office this week but I will make sure he sees this as soon as possible,general
Yes I think that ActionMailer should not depend on ActionView,design
milkie helped out a ton with this we worked on it during HackNY this weekend,general
I just changed the contents of this pull request slightly Somehow managed to fudge up a one line fix,general
I m running into this locally Can this be applied to v2 4,general
Call this QLockTimingWrapper class instead,design
We should think about storing a reference to search field so we can move methods like this to AbstractChosen,design
Yes thanks I forgot that hasDollar is a pointer,general
Hi azat in order to consider this we need you to open up a ticket,general
New pull request is 474,general
Where are you thinking of putting it instead of an alternate ModuleManager factory,design
Hello Thanks for looking at my pull request Actually I don t want to complete the Contributor Agreement form So I suggest you reject this request and fix yourself it is a small patch,general
It sounds like either method will work right now but there are some reasons to avoid using boost shared ptr,general
erh I haven t tried multiple machine yet I ll get it a try and see what parts are left and yes a test case would be good to have Thanks for your comments,general
Once you ve rebased you can use our linter to verify your code style python buildscripts lint py file Also note that tools files cpp was moved to src mongo tools files cpp some time ago,general
processFile and processFifo share too much copy paste code You ought to be able to write private methods openFifoFile and openRegularFile and then have a processFile function that takes an open and ready to read FILE object no,design
Thanks again for the pull request We fixed this with a very similar approach You can view more details on the fix in JIRA jira mongodb org browse SERVER 6008,general
It s a bit of a microoptimization since there s nobody to spuriously wake up when X n is 0 but it would not be incorrect semantically,general
It have been obsolute So I ll post new pull request,general
leave this assert in and change e n to count,general
Couldn t you always use the controller request That request object should be passed into the view as well,design
Replaced by github com mongodb mongo pull 114,general
i agree if you are sure notify one is fast with no waiters,general
nitpick style long line 100 chars max,general
You should test the length of some real fields as well such as the text field in the articles,general
Hi IanWhalen done jira mongodb org browse SERVER 7750,general
It would be nice for the history to contain a literal transcription of what the user typed,general
However that might prove to be a behavior change in some other cases that I haven t considered,general
Hey I signed the agreement Now you can merge the changes,general
It might make sense to keep a ControllerLoaderFactory in place that simply extends the ControllerManagerFactory We would not register the factory but that way if somebody was extending it it would continue to work,design
I will reissue all my pull requests rebased to try to prevent this piling on effect,general
Closing this old pull request as the SERVER ticket was resolved,general
Thanks we re in non critical code freeze for 2 3 1 right now but I ll merge this in when the freeze is lifted,general
I can only see this in master no other branches,general
I just re submitted the agreement,general
Hi Alexis I tested this and see that the default awk on redhat 5 7 and 6 2 don t accept s as a whitespace character It looks good to me otherwise though What do you think about using blank instead,general
Hi Michael Thank you for the pull request I see that you have signed the contributor s agreement and there is already a SERVER ticket I will get someone to review your changes as soon as possible,general
I think this pull request is now ready to be merged,general
redmeadowman thanks for opening up this pull request Before we can take a look to consider merging this we ll need you to sign the contributor agreement at www 10gen com contributor,general
it should all be opt in some facade to have previous behavior I guess,design
Closing as duplicate of SERVER 4161 These tests were merged,general
Ah thanks for the info,general
sure UnitTest is something that runs at every server startup so they must very light and fast real tests should go in dbtests test binary or jstests if applicable running tests v good idea see smoke page on wiki,general
Thanks IanWhalen I ve signed the Contributor Agreement,general
Why is this not merged And or code reviewed I ld love to see this integrated,general
stoll doesn t exist in Visual Studio 2008 I m installing the windows 7 SDK to see if that will rectify it but perhaps even being dirty and calling atol would be better than causing build problems,general
Can you switch the C style casts to C style Just for the lines you modified you can leave the others,general
ah i see thank you,general
I have updated the JIRA ticket with the updated unclean patch with which the smoketest passes on Ubuntu ARMv7,general
Yeah either that or fix the message,general
Hi I ve added a test case for this issue So is it possible to merge this fix,general
Note that dump cpp has the same code see SERVER 1833If we change it in export cpp we should make the same change in dump cpp,general
barretod you can follow the status of this particular feature in our official feature tracking system,general
Any intention of merging this It d be a super handy feature for dealing with timeStart timeEnd type problems upserting aggregates,general
Why did you remove these assertions Since they seem to work for everyone else it s safer to first assume there s something wrong on your setup and that we should figure out what that is,general
syntion yeah you right I haven t tried to build it with use sasl client and ssl and decided to not remove these files in case someone added them on purpose,general
I ve merged your commit into this pull request please take a look It seems working even better Thank you,general
Sorry about that The new things are just so shiny,general
Couple of notes we re not going to change the type from number to string names should be consistent between dbstats collstats keeping commit log clean is important,general
No plans to merge the auth part atleast to v2 0,general
I will make a new pull request then,general
102 is a bit better,general
Ping Tim I still need these issues fixed before we can proceed,general
Weird Other tests call it and it worked on my machine I ll look into it,general
Test doesnt pass because documentEq isnt defined,general
Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub github,general
Thanks for your comment I chose trim as it is used in e redis but renaming it is simple,general
Ok I understand Thanks for the feedback,general
So the solution for my problem would be to create a facade for the all uses of Process,design
It isnt LogMessageFatal calls abort which should stop the server,general
Did you see different behavior in practice,general
Verify stops the server if the condition is false and prints out a stack trace other info,general
miketheman I remember that I comment here,general
In general I would prefer patches on top of current master it is hard to read diffs,general
Not sure how easy githb makes this,general
Is there a reason you put slaveOk in the middle rather than the end so we can preserve backwards compatibility,general
I would still like to do it just not very high on my to do list anymore,general
If you prefer I can make changes on my end and update the pull request just tell me,general
Sorry for the delay getting back to you Two minor nits then I would be happy to merge,general
Have you completed the contributor agreement,general
You should likely define a factory for the DbSelect adapter instead Having conditional logic based on type is a recipe for problems,design
Why did you add the copy and assignment ops I think those are the same as the automatically generated ones,general
see abovecould make LOG if performance was the concern,general
added this commit to avoid using eval,general
I couldnt find any references for updating If thats included in what you have done some portion of that is still relevant after renaming,general
I would also like to see this method not get overriden in the future,design
Could that syncing process be updated to ensure that the changes made here are incorporated,general
I will try to have a look at it,general
You might lose files because fsync on a file doesnt quarantine that the file is visible in directory,general
you are right was only backported for mongostat not mongotop,general
Closing for now as discussed via email,general
Closing so that I can create three separate pull requests,general
We can build a facade for askDocComment,design
Also we should put in a link to the new documentation site and a mention of the mongo users google group,general
I agree Just added to remove the non determinism,general
That would work,general
Eliot I decided that your way would be better in any case see previous commit,general
Merged in c0e30cdd5623,general
Writing tests to cover all export options imo should be another issue,general
The pull request of RexMorgan is clean and simple it cannot introduce any bug and could be very usefull,general
Please merge it soon,general
Dont think this is something we want to do,general
Too high a risk of having bizarre errors,general
Thanks Justin I see the updated contributors agreement Looks good now,general
When will this get integrated Any feedback,general
probably should have clarified the commit message first not the end of the world merged,general
Don t you think 454 can be a better way for upstart I m really open for suggestions,general
You are correct sir,general
I m going to take another look at this,general
Damn Im glad Im not as stupid as the guy who wrote this,general
It just wont create the file,general
I am using the cleaner approach in peregrine and it is working well the only caveat is using a ByteBuffer that has been closed will cause the VM to segfault Putting a facade in front of it can prevent this from happening though if you first check for an isClosed state,general
This also gets called if the size is not greater than 0,general
Merged in 23f8257fa Thank you for contributing to MongoDB Xiuming,general
hiis it works well,general
Hi Abhijit can you fix the indent and tab issues noted above,general
Hi I already did it yesterday,general
Drew is getting ahead of himself cbegin and cend are C 11 names begin and end are fine,general
Took me a bit but I got the hang of squashing things That change should address all the comments,general
forget it bsonobj getField whatever numberDouble did the trick got another mistake in code just ignore my input,general
I have signed it,general
what if somebody substitutes an alternate DbSelect implementation that isnt compatible with this Alternately modify the DbSelect adapter,design
Hi azat could you open a ticket in the MongoDB JIRA with a link to this pull request Thanks,general
please merge,general
should be return LOG INFO,general
This is released in 20,general
This log message made my entire evening during which I was harshly awoken and summoned to fix things,general
You are a hero nay a champion I salute you,general
what happened here,general
We have been waiting for a long time for something like this for solving SERVER 991 ,general
What release version can we expect on this one,general
Thanks guys Looks great,general
DiskLoc is no bigger than a pointer so probably fine to pass by value,general
In fact i once had a bug in the btree code due to an alias of a DiskLoc s value being modified during recursion,general
Hi I have created a JIRA for this,general
I had changed it several times and never fixed yet Currently 5 or 30 seconds is fitting on our system,general
Mind if I leave the SERVER ticket open and assigned to you but close this pull request Feel free to reopen when you have something for us to review,general
This is probably asking to move the moon but is it possible to move away from scons as to be able to build this without mods from master,general
cxmcc I see your updated contributors agreement it looks good Thanks,general
first commit on the server yeah satisfied,general
This is the wrong place to wire it Since it has to do with dispatch logic it should not be in the ViewManager,design
Hi miketheman Ok I will update my patch during upcoming week and afterwards I will open a new ticket in JIRA Thanks for your time Tomas,general
Well original CHECK is not fatal Do you really think this should be changed And I m not familiar with MongoDB s codebase what does verify do,general
At present you can use this class as a CB class that only expresses externally as the Bukkit interface ChunkSnapshot,design
You have stopped adding the edit command to the shell history,general
Missing a space between if expression,general
ok but the arabic is also simple even it is appearing complex arabic language accepts the stemming and mongodb is fully unicode so i dont see why it was not included,general
Wow I really need these cool patches,general
Yeah I can do that some time later today or tomorrow,general
Hi Alexis Please see my comment about the contributor agreement,general
Thank you for contributing,general
We could drop the R since it wouldnt be necessary when we actually create the dirs Or simply check if the directory exists before calling mkdir chown,general
Thank you At first glance these look like good changes We will do some further review and testing,general
I created a mongodb JIRA issue for the projection support in bsondump so we will see what happens,general
But as a generic container one can make your own class that implements the ChunkSnapshot interface just as easily the value IMHO is in being able to tweak or manipulate the snapshot without having to copy all the data into another container,design
I just did,general
I tested releaseConnectionsAfterResponse option and it looks good And you d better add a setParameter option to set it dynamically,general
Azat The feature request needs to be fully considered and fit into the overall dev cycle before that s necessary,general
Sorry ronelliott please clarify your request What would you like,general
Looks like the finishCode call was removed I have added it and verified that multiline editing works as intended Apologies for not catching this earlier,general
Thanks for the feedback I updated the request and signed the contributor agreement,general
Hi Matt Thank you for reply I have signed the agreement,general
right will take it out,general
erh I think it would be better to have a look at the test cases I have written The commit message isn t very good I ll certainly agree to that,general
Hi Matt Yes I signed it and confirmed Thanks for looking at this so soon,general
If delayEnd delayBegin this should either be an error or should be compressed into delay,general
Bah this was a one line change I m not sure why it pulls in 53 other changes,general
andy10gen When you get a chance this will re introduce multi line editing I had previously removed the code and not noticed it in the diff,general
hlobil my apologies for closing this without further details this particular pull request was closed while the submitter reworks some of it and then resubmits,general
No code changes have been made,general
Okay but what is the proper way of concatenating an int to a string in the mongo codebase,general
I would highly recommend squashing these commits when you do the merge I didnt do it myself because I wasnt sure how GitHub review system would handle it since we have comments associated with the specific commits,general
that is an accident will remove,general
andy pulled it into 2 0 5 today,general
i will write a comment to mention that this is intentional,general
Is this pull request going to be reissued and added in a future release,general
Subsumed by another fix,general
Contributor Agreement signed change pulled into master,general
Add SERVER 7800 to commit message 2bfd087b2a7a095279ad75bc90d3722edd55d126,general
However I think the concept of const iterator is sufficiently well known in C that you could omit this comment,general
It is more work to determine which collection to lock and this line is hit rarely if at all,general
I have an alternate patch that leaves the current implementation for all platforms but Linux if there is opposition to using the monotonic time syscalls,general
Go for it,general
Looks like you need to install pymongo the python mongodb driver ,general
Instructions on how to do that are available here,general
Small typo here unauthenteicated unauthenticated,general
obj name Double is the canonical method,general
thanks would work either way but i have a slight preference to by value,general
I will reissue all my pull requests rebased to try to prevent this piling on effect,general
Thanks Indeed the shim was needed Sorry for not paying close attention,general
Hi Abhijit This looks better than than 425 but I see some style issues Tabs for indentation Misaligned indent perhaps due to above,general
Please fix per our kernel style guide,general
You can make it easy to see these in git as follows,general
Again default to None,general
Would this feature not also be useful as well in mongodump,general
Hi Does this work without numactl installed,general
iI means with that specific word it has several spaces which I imagine will break stuff It should probably have been on a new line,general
erh Sorry I meant that I have only relaxed it for trim aka slice which by my definition states that it will always be evaluated after any other modifier So it is backwards compatible,general
Sorry about that I was in a rush to get this done as part of a presentation and must have missed the agreement instructions Signed and confirmed,general
okay will rebranch it again and put the link,general
see coding styleif else,general
I concur So for now I will leave this as is,general
The code as written is correct I think your new code will cause a crash,general
Could you please fix the whitespace error on line 233 of string data test cpp,general
erh What do you think of the redis implementation of TTL redis io commands expire,general
Hi MichaelBrenden thanks for opening up this pull request Before we can take a look to consider merging,general
thanks just pushed an attempted fix,general
Thanks I will submit a fix to master for this shortly,general
should line up with the first from above,general
Right I just used the same types of casts as were there before Nested reinterpreted casts statements will look quite weird,general
should we enable this now,general
strncpy is problematic because it is easy to mess up and not 0 terminate the destination strcpy,general
it makes sure the src length is less than the size of the destination buffer,general
what s timeout value you set in your system,general
andy10gen original behaviour was to call abort if check failed,general
Would be good to write a test before we merge this in,general
Okay I moved the logic to the if statement,general
Does this have any benefit to the shell users,general
why does this test need to load this it should not be calling this method,design
Hi Thanks for pointing this out We re determining the best course of action and will address this issue in an upcoming,general
I see Can you make a feature request and link this pull request,general
40708e54a41f833933d748383d563cf7c9092744 applies your commit sorry for the wait Thank you for contributing,general
regex patterns must have BSON regex or string type,general
There is already a fix in mongodb repository,general
this pull request can be closed,general
IanWhalen I noticed this was lingering so I rebased it atop master I had hoped it was trivial enough to merge through GitHub,general
should I open a codereview issue on it,general
