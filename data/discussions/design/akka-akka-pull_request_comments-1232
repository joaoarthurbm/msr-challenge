<viktorklang> Isn't there a risk of silent issues here?
<drewhk> This should not be here, this is specific to the TestTransport
<patriknw> without it this test fails: https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/master/akka-remote/src/test/scala/akka/remote/RemotingSpec.scala#L139
Let us verify that again, but I think it had something with "akka.test" protocol not registered, which is a good error to log.
<drewhk> No, it does not mean that "akka.test" is not regisered -- that would is  
logged elsewhere. This specific error message is the way of TestTransport  
to tell you that there is no remote transport that listens to that  
address. This is an analogue of trying to connect to a port that no one  
listens to.
<patriknw> ah, then I misunderstood the error message, I'll revisit that and probably have to delete that test (or do you have a suggestion of how to test)?
<drewhk> You might as well change the error message :) You can listen to  
AssociationErrorEvent as it will be published by the publishAndThrow call.
<patriknw> alright
<patriknw> verified with Endre
<patriknw> fixed
<patriknw> fixed
