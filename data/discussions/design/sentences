This is not supposed to be used externally.,design
it should use an ExecutorServiceConfigurator so it can be managed externally.,design
this class is an internal structure.,design
True will make public again. On the other hand we have other places which require external implementors.,design
No this is cheating by using low-level API that shouldn't even be exposed.,design
Since the SelectionHandler ref is not exposed.,design
Method is exposed to subclasses to be able to implement custom.,design
an implementation detail that shouldn't be exposed to users.,design
would it be possible to make actor accessible in the public API?,design
we can add new methods to Context without accidentally breaking peoples Actors evolve the api without breaking user code.,design
Why does it return a leaking implementation detail?,design
Should probably use composition instead of inheritance.,design
Should this class be public?,design
UnsupportedActorRef already implements ScalaActorRef.,design
Is this a public method?,design
Why does this extend ScalaActorRef?,design
I think that RoutedActorRef is going to be a part of the API.,design
to do a redesign on this part.,design
current approach is not very extensible friendly.,design
Should this class be public?,design
it should be part of the Api.,design
This is how it is implemented in the ClusteredActorRef the design of the RoutedActorRef was based on.,design
Can't that be solved with overloading?,design
the current design isn't very exensible,design
I would have modelled it.,design
we should expose implementation details or not perhaps we should discuss it.,design
should be updated to not use.,design
Any internal usages that should be updated?,design
refactoring should be kept separate as one is changing user API and one is internal implementaiton details.,design
change the internals.,design
I agree that this shouldn't be exposed.,design
is SchedulerException ever exposed to users? ,design
Make it private?,design
The events need to be private and should not be exposed.,design
They are for internal use only.,design
Users can use awaitActivation methods from Activation.,design
I'll make it private,design
that other internal events are published in akka as public classes.,design
it is dangerous as they are internals and we are not prepared to expose them.,design
they are exposing the internals of implementation and break encapsulation.,design
I've made them internal again.,design
minimize exposure.,design
This whole structure is specific to this actor and should not be used anywhere else.,design
It is not the job of this structure to enforce that.,design
internal should not be publicly visible.,design
This should not be here this is specific to the TestTransport.,design
Some implicit conversion that is only for internal use?,design
I think it's good enough if we make an internal utility method,design
this is the way to create RoutedActorRefs.,design
low-level API that shouldn't even be exposed.,design
Should not be used.,design
api type. Perhaps this is just internal.,design
this should go inside RemoteWatcher.props.,design
places that use props factory method pattern.,design
it must be better to define all props in the props factory.,design
it should be `getContext().actorOf`.,design
these should be internal API.,design
It should then be marked as internal API.,design
actor extending UntypedProcessor.,design
`Message` creation inside and outside a processor.,design
The reason for `private[persistence]` is that it is used by the `RecoverOnRestart` trait.,design
will become either INTERNAL API or `private`.,design
What about moving the above `preStart` implementation to `Processor`?,design
processors can only override `preRestartProcessor`,design
we could move the preRestart and postRestart implementations to Processor.,design
concrete processors should override preRestartProcessor and postRestartProcessor.,design
using an actor context in the wrong place.,design
It will be called only if users create new outbound messages via Message.,design
My assumptions about LevelDB API might be incorrect.,design
move from ActorRef to pattern.,design
OldActor so that existing code works inside actors.,design
Add needed implicit conversion in this package.scala file so that existing code works outside actors.,design
Document as internal and make final.,design
I like to move it move it.,design
should be private.,design
I'd definitely recommend making DeadLetterActorRef a subtype of EmptyLocalActorRef.,design
why is this class public?,design
I'm guessing this should be private and documented as internal.,design
would it be possible to move to context?,design
should not be user extendable yet.,design
prevent subclassing by user code.,design
its only use-case within the library is.,design
why not private?,design
I think it can be private.,design
Because otherwise we wouldn’t know how to create a Future.,design
we could also change that to require an implicit ExecutionContext.,design
ActorRefProvider does not expose a reference to its ActorSystem.,design
Subclassing applies to ActorSystem or ActorCell.,design
A factory to create MessageQueues for an optionally provided ActorContext.,design
why is it exposed?,design
The rest of the ActorPath handling is also not private.,design
So you don’t want people to implement MessageDispatcher?,design
I think we should only export not the other ones.,design
it probably makes more sense to mark as private packages.,design
I would personally keep that export.,design
to move the things from org.jboss.netty.akka.util to akka.util.,design
config will become an explicit dependency as well.,design
only used internally or should they be exposed in the API?,design
If just internal you could consider to put them into akka.internal.util.,design
We'll make them package protected.,design
suggest to just wrap in a RemoteTransportException and rethrow and let the layer above decide if it should be logged or not.,design
Just wrap in a RemoteTransportException and let the caller decide if it should be logged or not.,design
This should be private and be documented as internal api.,design
Why not throw an exception here instead of having to check for None in the code which uses it?,design
Shouldn't getChild be only in UntypedActorContext? It's purpose is for java api.,design
ActorCell must implement both and ActorContext does not expose the Java variant,design
This should be pulled out of the trait since it is a constant put in some object.,design
now you're exposing "this" to another Actor.,design
private this.,design
These should be in a companion object like usual.,design
If the extension you have a reference to ExtendedActorSystem.,design
If you want to log directly to j.u.l. then you should use that api directly.,design
It allows the Akka Logging API to be used outside of Actor systems.,design
is that it doesn't require any dependencies.,design
Instead of directly calling into the ConcurrentSocketActor through methods like connect bind etc you should send messages to the actor.,design
But you're calling out to the methods of the Actor which is a violation of the ActorModel.,design
methods inside the select-function? (or are they used internally in the actor as well?,design
No they are only invoked from #select and should not be invoked from any other site either inside or outside the actor.,design
so move them into the select function.,design
it's better to create the actor inside the newSocket method and pass the supervisor into it.,design
you might as well move the method definition into receiveFrames.,design
it should be: private.,design
will this be exposed in some way in Spray?,design
